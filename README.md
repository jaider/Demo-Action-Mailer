# Demo of Action Mailer Standalone
Action Mailer Standalone implementation in a Console application. 
Action Mailer helps to unfold the power of Razor Engine into emails, by creating templates (html or text) and binding model to them. Great library!

I am using an old library version but it works just fine. This project was made for VS 2010 few years ago and I just tested in  VS 2013 and works.
